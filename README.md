## Project Overview

The **Sales Analytics System** is a Python-based end-to-end data pipeline designed to process raw sales transaction data into clean, enriched, and insightful business outputs. The system performs data ingestion, cleaning, validation, analytics, API-based enrichment, and automated report generation using a modular architecture.

---

## Key Features

- Robust raw data cleaning and validation
- Extensive sales analytics and visualizations
- API-based product enrichment
- CSV, text, and image-based outputs
- Fully automated end-to-end pipeline execution

## Module Descriptions

### `main.py`

**Role:** Central orchestrator of the Sales Analytics System.

**Description:**
- Executes the full pipeline sequentially
- Coordinates data cleaning, analytics, enrichment, and report generation
- Displays step-wise progress logs and handles high-level exceptions

---

### `utils/file_handler.py`

**Purpose:** Raw data ingestion, parsing, validation, and cleaning.

**Responsibilities:**
- Reads raw sales data with multi-encoding fallback support
- Parses pipe-delimited or reconstructed records
- Validates mandatory fields and business rules
- Computes transaction amounts
- Writes cleaned output to `output/Sales_cleaned_data.txt`

---

### `utils/data_processor.py`

**Purpose:** Sales analytics, aggregations, visualization, and structured exports.

**Responsibilities:**
- Loads cleaned sales data
- Calculates key sales metrics (revenue, volume, customer behavior)
- Performs region-wise, product-wise, customer-wise, and daily trend analysis
- Generates charts (bar and line plots)
- Exports analytical summaries as CSV files into the `output/` directory
- For exporting chart in to .png file, run the below command in command prompt post moving to root folder of project
    'sales-analytics-system/utils/python data_processor.py --export'

---

### `utils/api_handler.py`

**Purpose:** External API integration and transaction enrichment.

**Responsibilities:**
- Fetches product details from an external API
- Creates in-memory product mappings
- Enriches sales transactions with category, brand, price, rating, and match flags
- Saves enriched transactions to `Data/enriched_sales_data.txt`

---

### `utils/sales_report_generation.py`

**Purpose:** Automated text-based report generation.

**Responsibilities:**
- Combines cleaned and enriched data
- Computes high-level KPIs
- Produces a structured, human-readable sales report
- Saves the final report to `output/sales_report.txt`

---

## Analytics Output Files (Generated by `data_processor.py`)

The following data summary files are generated as part of the analytics phase and saved in the `output/` directory:

- **`region_sales_summary.csv`**  
  Contains region-wise total revenue, transaction count, and percentage contribution.

- **`top_products_summary.csv`**  
  Lists top-performing products based on quantity sold and revenue generated.

- **`customer_summary.csv`**  
  Provides per-customer metrics such as total spend, number of orders, and product diversity.

- **`daily_trend_summary.csv`**  
  Shows daily revenue, transaction counts, and unique customer activity for trend analysis.

- **`low_performing_products.csv`**  
  Identifies products with sales volume below a defined threshold for performance monitoring.

Additionally, the module generates **PNG visualizations** (bar charts and line graphs) corresponding to the above summaries. Instructions for the same have been explained under `utils/data_processor.py`

---

## Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<vikas0129-eng>/sales-analytics-system.git
cd sales-analytics-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

This executes the complete pipeline:
1. Cleans and validates raw sales data
2. Performs analytics and generates summaries
3. Enriches transactions using API data
4. Produces a comprehensive sales report
